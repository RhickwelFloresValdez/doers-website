            <p>
                As a nonprofit organization, DOERs is dedicated to preserving the natural beauty of our surroundings while also making a lasting impact on local communities. The organization focuses on several key initiatives, all aimed at creating a healthier, more sustainable future for both humans and the environment.
                <br /><br />
                One of DOERs' primary goals is to ensure the cleanliness of local roads and beaches in La Union, Philippines. By organizing daily beach clean-up drives and monthly ploggings (jogging and picking up the trashes) as well as helping to protect marine life and prevent pollution from affecting both land and sea. 
                <br /><br />
                Beyond environmental efforts, DOERs is also committed to addressing the immediate needs of the community. We conduct feeding programs for underprivileged families, organizes tree planting and tree parenting activities. In addition to that, DOERs in regularly hosts blood drives and medical missions, providing essential healthcare services to those who need them most.
                <br /><br />
                The best way to think of us honestly is that we're a group of volunteers that is focused on volunteering to different advocacies we believe in. So if you're looking for a group of volunteers - That's DOERs.
